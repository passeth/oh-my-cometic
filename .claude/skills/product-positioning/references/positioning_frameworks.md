# Product Positioning Frameworks for Cosmetics

## 1. The Positioning Triangle

The foundation of effective product positioning rests on three interconnected elements:

```
                    TARGET AUDIENCE
                         /\
                        /  \
                       /    \
                      /      \
                     /        \
                    /          \
                   /____________\
        COMPETITIVE           POINT OF
        FRAME                DIFFERENCE
```

### Components:

**Target Audience**
- Who specifically will buy this product?
- What are their unmet needs?
- What motivates their purchase decisions?

**Competitive Frame**
- What category does this product compete in?
- Who are the direct alternatives?
- What reference points will consumers use?

**Point of Difference**
- What makes this product uniquely valuable?
- Why should consumers choose this over alternatives?
- Is the difference meaningful and sustainable?

## 2. Perceptual Mapping Framework

### Standard Two-Dimensional Map

```
High Price
    │
    │    Luxury        Prestige
    │    (Whoo)        (Sulwhasoo)
    │
    │────────────────────────────── High Efficacy
    │
    │    Value         Masstige
    │    (Innisfree)   (Laneige)
    │
Low Price
```

### Multi-Dimensional Mapping Axes

| Dimension Pair | Best For | Example Products |
|----------------|----------|------------------|
| Price vs. Efficacy | Treatment products | Serums, Actives |
| Natural vs. Scientific | Positioning strategy | Clean beauty vs. Derma |
| Trendy vs. Classic | Brand positioning | K-beauty vs. Heritage |
| Fun vs. Serious | Packaging/branding | Color cosmetics |
| Accessible vs. Exclusive | Distribution strategy | Mass vs. Premium |

### Creating Effective Perceptual Maps

1. **Select relevant dimensions** based on category drivers
2. **Plot all competitors** objectively
3. **Identify white spaces** (unoccupied positions)
4. **Assess white space viability** (is there demand?)
5. **Position strategically** in valuable white space

## 3. Brand Positioning Ladder

```
Level 5: VALUES/BELIEFS
         │ "We believe in the power of nature"
         ▼
Level 4: PERSONALITY TRAITS
         │ "Authentic, innovative, caring"
         ▼
Level 3: EMOTIONAL BENEFITS
         │ "Feel confident and radiant"
         ▼
Level 2: FUNCTIONAL BENEFITS
         │ "Visibly brighter skin in 14 days"
         ▼
Level 1: PRODUCT ATTRIBUTES
         "Contains 15% stable vitamin C"
```

### Application:
- **Mass brands** typically communicate at Levels 1-2
- **Masstige brands** bridge Levels 2-3
- **Prestige brands** emphasize Levels 3-4
- **Luxury brands** operate primarily at Levels 4-5

## 4. Value Proposition Canvas
